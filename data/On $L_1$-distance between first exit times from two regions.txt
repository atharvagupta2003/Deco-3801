Abstract
First exit times from regions and their dependence on variations of boundaries are
discussed for diﬀusion processes. The paper presents an estimate of L1-distance between
exit times from two regions via expectations of exit times.
Abbreviated title: On L1-distance between ﬁrst exit times
It is known that ﬁrst exit times from a region for smooth solutions of ordinary equations
does not depend continuously on variations of the initial data or on the boundary of the
region.
But ﬁrst exit times for non-smooth trajectories of diﬀusion processes have some
path-wise regularity with respect to these variations (some related results can be found in
author’s papers (1987),(1992)). This paper studies path-wise dependence on ﬂuctuations of
the boundary for ﬁrst exit times of diﬀusion processes. We present an eﬀective estimate of
L1-distance between exit times from two regions for a diﬀusion process via expectations of
exit times.
Let (Ω, F, P) be a standard probability space. Consider a n-dimensional diﬀusion process
y(t) such that
dy(t) = f(y(t))dt + β(y(t))dw(t),
t > 0,
(1)
y(0) = a.
(2)
Here w(t) is a standard d-dimensional Wiener process, f and β are non-random functions
with respective values in Rn and Rn×d. The random vector a with values in Rn does not
depend on w(·).
All vectors and matrices are real, and ¯D denotes the closure of a region D.

Further, for x ∈Rn, we denote by yx(t) the solution of (1) with the initial condition
y(0) = x.
For a set Γ ∈Rn, we denote τ(Γ)
∆= inf{t : y(t) ∈Γ}. This is the ﬁrst times of achieving
D of the processes y(t). Similarly, we denote τ x(Γ)
∆= inf{t : yx(t) ∈Γ}.
Let D1, D2 be two bounded regions in Rn. Let Γi = ∂Di be the boundary of Di.
We assume that the boundaries of Di are C1-smooth. Further, we assume that all the
components of the functions f, β are continuously diﬀerentiable, and b(x)b(x)⊤≥cIn, where
In is the unit matrix in Rn×n, and c > 0 is a constant.

Note the theorem is oriented on the case when D1\D2 ̸= ∅and D2\D1 ̸= ∅. If D1 ⊂D2
or D2 ⊂D1 then the estimation (3) is obvious.
Example. Let n = d = 1, ya(t) = a + w(t), D0 = (0, 1), Dε = (ε, 1 + ε), where ε ∈[0, 1).
Let Γε
∆= {ε, 1 + ε}. Let τ a
ε = inf{t : ya(t) ∈Γε}. We have that Eτ x
ε = (x −ε)(1 + ε −x) for
any x ∈Dε (it can be found similarly (4) and (9) below). By Theorem 1, it follows that

= ε(1 −ε).
Remark We assumed that the boundaries and coeﬃcients are smooth, the diﬀusion is non-
degenerate, and the regions are bounded. In fact, these conditions can be lifted provided
that the right hand part of (3) is ﬁnite. For example, a similar theorem can be obtained for
ﬁrst exit times of the process (y(t), t) from cylindrical regions Di × (0, T), i = 1, 2, T > 0, for
the case of time dependent coeﬃcients f and β.
Proof of Theorem 1. Let vi = vi(x) : Di →R, i = 1, 2, be the solutions in Di of the
Dirichlet problems
Lvi = −1,
vi|Γi = 0.

where fk, yl, and bk,l are the components of the vectors f, y and the matrix b = ββ⊤. As is
known, the problem (4) has the unique solution that is twice continuously diﬀerentiable up
to the boundary.

Let e1 and e2 be the indicator functions of the random events {τ(Γ1) > τ(Γ2)} and
{τ(Γ2) > τ(Γ1)} respectively.
Let Ft be the ﬁltration generated by w(t) and a.
Let bτ
∆= τ(Γ1) ∧τ(Γ2). The random variables ei are measurable with respect to the σ-
algebras Fbτ, Fτ(Γi), i = 1, 2, associated with the Markov times (with respect to the ﬁltration
Ft) bτ and τ(Γi) (see, e.g., Gihman and Skorohod (1975), Chap. 4, §2). Using Itˆo’s formula,
we obtain the equality
E {e1v1[y(τ(Γ2))]}
= −E {e1{v1[y(τ(Γ1))] −v1[y(τ(Γ2))]}}
= −E

= E {e1[τ(Γ1) −bτ]}
= E {e1[τ(Γ1) −τ(Γ2)]} .
(6)
If we replaced the indices 1, 2 in (6) by 2,1, we get similarly that
E {e2v2[y(τ(Γ1))]} = E {e2[τ(Γ2) −τ(Γ1)]} .
(7)
Clearly,
E|τ(Γ1) −τ(Γ2)| = E {e1[τ(Γ1) −τ(Γ2)]} + E {e2[τ(Γ2) −τ(Γ1)]} .
(8)
We have that
vi(x) = E τ x(Γi).
(9)
Then it follows from (6)-(8) that
E|τ(Γ1) −τ(Γ2)|
≤E {e1[τ(Γ1) −τ(Γ2)]} + E {e2[τ(Γ2) −τ(Γ1)]}
= E {e1{v1[y(τ(Γ2))]} + E {e2{v2[y(τ(Γ1))]}
≤max

Now the assertion of the Theorem 1 follows. ✷
